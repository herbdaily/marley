=Marley

Marley is a framework for building RESTful web services and applications with roughly _O(n)_ lines code where _n_ is lines of DDL.

It consists of several parts:

* A simple Rack application that acts as request parser/router.
* A default controller for ORM model classes.
* A plugin system similar to Sequel's.
* Marley Joints - A framework for creating reusable Marley resource sets.
* Reggae - A JSON data format

The point of the whole thing is to minimize the amount of non-model (non-datacentric) code that needs to be written to implement a web service/application.

Please see the examples/forum.rb and the included Joints' code to get a basic idea of what a Marley application looks like.

==Marley Resources

Marley resources are constants in the Marley::Resources namespace.

* A resource must respond either to a #controller method or to one or more REST verbs (#rest_get, #rest_post, #rest_put, or #rest_delete). 
* A #controller method must return an object that responds to one or more REST verbs.
* REST verb methods should return an object with a #to_json method.


==The Parser/Router

The parser splits the request path on '/' and treats the first part as the requested resource.  If no resource is specified in the request, it uses the default resource.  

if the resource has a REST method corresponding the the request verb, the parser calls that method and sends the return value to the client.

The parser also traps various errors and returns the appropriate error message to the client.

==The Default Model Controller

One of the things that the RestConvenience Sequel plugin does is add a #controller method to affected models.  This method instantiates and returns a ModelController object for the model in question.  At initialization, the Controller parses the request path to determine the model instances to which the request refers.

==Jamaica

The default Marley client is "Jamaica", which consists of JS/CSS for browsers.  It has now been moved to a separate repository at https://github.com/herbdaily/jamaica
